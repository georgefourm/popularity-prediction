In fact it\\'s necessary to put both the pre and post-2007 rules into one timezone because a meeting that recurs over a time period that crosses from 2006 into 2007 needs to have its recurrences calculated out according to both the old and the new DST rules. I quite liked what I heard from Patrik at the meeting, that people actually schedule meetings with reference to the time in a particular *place* rather than in a particular timezone. I\\'ve seen more software recently, probably based on the Olsen database, allow the user to pick a place like \"America/San Francisco\" rather than a timezone like PST. I hope that means is that when I schedule recurring meetings in San Francisco the recurrence is always calculated according to the best known time in San Francisco even if San Francisco were to secede from PST.
