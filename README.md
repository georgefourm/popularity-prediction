# IETF Sentiment Analysis
This is a project that attempts to perform sentiment analysis
on IETF mailing lists and then correlate the results with progress
made on Internet Drafts.

This project and its findings constitute a master's thesis.

## Setup

to add to a `.env` file at the root of the project
